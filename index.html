            <p>I'm a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript;dabbling with Python and Ruby; and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information
                through a
                few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.</p>
